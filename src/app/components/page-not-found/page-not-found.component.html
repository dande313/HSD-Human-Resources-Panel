<h4>Sorry! The route you are trying to access does exist. It might've once been here, and been deleted. Or it might never have been here. But it could've been... it could've been. That's quite the tragedy, don't you think? In this world of limitless possibilities, all sorts of things might've existed but do not. And just about everything, in the end, gets "erased". Hardly a soul is remembered 100 years after they pass away. There's not much of a difference between never existing and ceasing to exist, is there?</h4>
