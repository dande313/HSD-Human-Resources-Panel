<h4>Sorry! The route you are trying to access does exist. It might've once been here, and been deleted. Or it might never have been here. But it could've been... it could've been. That's quite the tragedy, don't you think? In this world of limitless possibilities, all sorts of things might've existed but do not. And just about everything, in the end, gets "erased". Hardly a soul is remembered 100 years after they pass away. There's not much of a difference between never existing and ceasing to exist, is there?</h4>

<h4>Some folks believe in a life after this one; that part of our essence, our spirit, our soul carries on to the next life. But the hard truth is, there are no guarantees. But even if we assume there is a part of us that carries on, how much of that spirit is really us? We know for certain that our memories are stored in our brains. Amnesia, dementia, alzheimers... it's all strong evidence that once our brains stop working, our memories cease to exist. Not to mention the countless biochemical reactions, the hormones, ect which bring to light certain facets of our personality. So if there were such a thing, who's to say your post-life spirit is really you?</h4>
